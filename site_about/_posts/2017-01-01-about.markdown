After a wonderful, intimate wedding overlooking Lake Tahoe on October 13th, 2017, Becca and Dan want to travel around to various places of the country to celebrate with their friends and extended families â€” thus, the birth of the 'Loman Love Tour' concept. Throughout the Summer of 2018, they will be bringing the party to several different friends-and-family hubs around the country.
