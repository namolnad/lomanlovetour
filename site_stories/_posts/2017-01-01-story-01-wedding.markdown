In a style classic to them, Becca and Dan chose to forgo a large, traditional wedding celebration â€” choosing instead to invite their immediate family members to spend several days together in their happy place, the greater Lake Tahoe region. The two families stayed together under one roof and combined forces to put together a beautiful, rustic Autumn ceremony bookended by wonderful meals, stunning outdoor views/activities and extremely pleasant familial socializing.
