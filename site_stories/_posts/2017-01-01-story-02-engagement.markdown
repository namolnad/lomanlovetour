description_header: How they were engaged
description_body: In case you ever want to know the long version to this story, you should know Becca tells it best... Ok, now that you're aware of thatâ€”after a morning of powder skiing and driving around Donner Summit's 10 foot snowbanks during blizzard'ing conditions, Dan shaved his mustache and took Becca out for a sunset nordic ski around the neighborhood where they were staying. After hearing Becca mention one particular cabin in which she could see them growing old together, Dan took the opportunity to stop skiing for a few moments. He read her the loveliest words ever written (sadly, the notes for which have since been lost) and then got down on one knee to ask her to marry him. After 3.5 hours of contemplation, she looked down with tear-filled eyes and confirmed that, 'yes', she would marry him. Afterward, they celebrated by enjoying champagne with their dear friend and weekend host, Sandy, and then ventured to Truckee for a private and low-key dinner at Cottonwood Restaurant (one of their favorites.)
