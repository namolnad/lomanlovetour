description_header: How Becca and Dan became Danecca
---
Becca and Dan met the morning of a group trail run which had been arranged by several of their mutual friends. After briefly introducing themselves to each other at a coffee shop that morning, they carpooled in Becca's car, 'Boop', to the trailhead. Dan then pretended he could keep with her during the run â€” unsurprisingly, it turns out it was indeed nothing more than pretending...

After the run, Dan did all he could to keep the conversation going through the group's email chain, piggybacking off of the fact that he had 2 reservations for the new iPhone model, one of which he had offered to Becca during the run. Emails then became texts. Texts became invites to dinner. And dinners quickly became a blossoming love.
