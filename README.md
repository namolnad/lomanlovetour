# Becca and Dan's Wedding Website
This is a site designed to inform guest of Becca and Dan's wedding 'Tour' about the events upcoming this summer. It is built on top of some open source software. See 'Attributions and Changes' section below.

## Attributions and Changes
This wedding website is built on a modified version of the [Event Jekyll Theme](https://event-jekyll-theme.github.io), created by Melvin Ch'ng, which was further built upon [Agency Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/y7kim/agency-jekyll-theme).

The source code has been modified (mostly pared down) appropriately to handle this particular event. See CHANGELOG for a list of changes.

Thank you to Melvin for your work on the Event Theme! Your work made the implementation of this site quite straightforwardâ€”which my wife and I thank you for :)
