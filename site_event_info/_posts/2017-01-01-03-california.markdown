description: Friends one and all, come to our home away from home in Truckee, CA! We'll be hosting a celebration at the base of Castle Peak. It'll be very casual; think hiking garb. The location is a short hike away from where you'll park, so bring hiking / trail shoes. <br><br>If you'd like to spend the night, bring a tent and / or sleeping bags! It's in a National Forest, so no reservations are needed. There are plenty of Airbnb options nearby as well for those who'd like a toilet.
